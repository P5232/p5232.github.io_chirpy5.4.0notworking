    "content": "Riding the wave of positive family religious experiences of late (see Sam’s Bar Mitzvah), we decided to venture back to Church after about an 8-year respite. Spoiler alert, it was actually a nice and welcoming experience. To find out more, read on; otherwise, you got the main point.It has been a tradition in my wife’s family to attend Christmas Eve services followed by dinner and some present opening. Being Jewish, this was a new experience to me. I went politely and did most the things beside the communion. But after many years of mostly hearing about Jesus and having young kids who couldn’t sit through a service, our family made the transition to skipping church, but keeping dinner and presents on the agenda.I understand why a Christian church would focus on Jesus so heavily. He is the main differentiation point between Christians and other religions. But from an outsider’s perspective, it is almost as if they forgot about God (I know Jesus is supposed to be God and the trinity and all, but it just doesn’t feel the same from outside looking in). I felt out-of-place most of the time.Now our kids are of an age that they are expected to where nice, uncomfortable clothes while attending services. We went to a new church last night call St. Margaret’s Church of Annapolis, MD. It was only an hour service making it easy for our kids and I can attend with our family. Something was different this time. Instead of a huge church with half the seats filled, it was a medium-sized building with the pews filled. The beginning started talking about the House of David and the decedents of Abraham, Issac, and Jacob. Put two check marks on the positive side of the ledger.Then Reverend Peter Mayer took some time to speak to the crowd. He opened with inclusive words of welcome. Knowing that many of the faces there were new to this congregation, he boasted that anyone is welcome to come take communion or at least come up for a blessing. He encouraged loud singing regardless of the tune of your voice since we are not here to be afraid, but to be joyous. He assured us God was here to help us when we are scared. God won’t heal us directly, but he can help us manage the situations we find ourselves in through family, friends, and community.There is a commonality between this message and the Bar Mitzvah service a couple weeks ago. In both instances, a large percentage of the congregation were not regularly attending members. Rabbi Steve Weisman and Reverend Peter Mayer both seemed please to welcome these new attendees regardless of their religious background. They both provided some upfront context that is often required for a newcomer to a strange place. Neither one tried to convert or stress the benefits of their chosen faith. Both focused on community and God.There is not one correct religion or belief system, and any faith community that thinks only they know best is not worth your time. There are many paths to any destination be it faith, health, education, or understanding. The more religions that are open to other religions, the better this world will be.We had a long discussion about Jesus the person and Jesus the savior on the way there and back. It was a great learning/teaching experience. I am looking forward to attending next year. One suggestion…can you work on some songs with a tempo that is faster than my resting heart-rate?"

    "content": "You see it coming 18,000 miles away. Not to worry.Twelve-year birthday; pick a Saturday. Text and Email family. Excitement brewing.Nine months away. The study with the Rabbi begins. Start slow. Summarize the Torah portion. Tallit blessing is a one-liner. The morning prayers accumulate week-by-week.Six months away and save-the-dates are delivered throughout the country. Reasons to talk to too-long neglected friends and family. Oh I hope they will come. This will be so much fun. When is the last time the family got together for a happy occasion?Three months to go. Booked the venue months ago; Buy the invitations; Send the invitations. The acceptance replies come in and warm our hearts. Who did we forget? Pick up the pace…you are not even at your Torah portion yet. We have much to do. Order the suits. Find a DJ. What should we serve? Are you still practicing your Hebrew? Time to go to your lesson…grab your things.Two months to go and things are getting real. Putting a day countdown on my phone homescreen. Torah portion Aliyah #2 is underway…two to go after this…we are doing it. Pick the menu, pick the DJ, pick the hotel. Did you want shuttles? Did you want dancers? What are you doing for photos? Would you like a videographer? Keep practicing your torah portion. Send the caterer deposit. Do we all have clothes for the event? No I don’t know what color table cloths I want.One month to go. Torah portions are DONE so enter Haftarah. Why are all these words so different from what we are used to…and no chanting to help the flow? Going to the tailor to fit your suits is a right of passage for young boys. Centerpieces need to be created. Did anyone order the wine and beer? Are we getting dancers? Who is on the montage? The tailor messed up the suit shirts…they will fix the shirt sleeve lengths. Don’t worry, there is still time. Are we doing a candle lighting? What songs does Sam like? No we can’t do the Russian national anthem. His Spotify playlist is not appropriate.One week to go. The fixed shirts are not fixed. Meg was right about this tailor. I can’t find a shirt that will arrive on time. There is one size 10 left at Macy’s; this will have to do. The Rabbi wants more additions to your speech, can you make those additions? I don’t know what he wants. He said what he wants. I don’t want that. Do your haftarah again; it needs work. I am done today. That last rehearsal was tough. There is still time. We need the candle lighting speeches and montage ASAP. We are on it, but not today. By the way, we need 7 challahs for Friday and Saturday. Two more rehearsals. Make those changes to your speech. I am hyperventilating. Calm down. It is almost over. It is about to start.24 hours of madness. Family are in town. Practice the speeches. Ut-oh, writing these words were easier than saying them out loud. Why is the meaning too emotional for me to get through it? I’ll try again later. Pick up the challahs and the cake. This store only has 2; wtf. Write and practice the party introductions. Pick up the kids early from school. Is Sam getting sick? This isn’t good. He barely slept last night. Get dressed for dinner. There are 25 people here getting hyped for the big event. Hurry up people, we can’t be late to our sevice. The red suit shines through. Sam takes his Hebrew name and slyly tempts the audience to tune in tomorrow for the full story. The sore throat is of second importance. I am the man tonight. Ventilation is good, just hyper. Go home and sleep. Did we print enough services…our toner says it is low. Try to sleep.The morning of, time starts to slow. I have to remind myself to not rush just to sit in our suits waiting. The screens distract them as I load the car and check my list. We head to Temple with plenty of time on the clock. With more than 30 minutes to prepare, we meet with the early arrivals as the Rabbi regails us with stories of V’shamru spinning-ritual origin story. My brother brings my long-lost Tallit which makes the day all that much more special. He takes pictures of the family on the Bimah. He doesn’t have to clue us to smile as they won’t leave our faces. Time marches to T-minus-zero as the seats fill with all those familiar faces we were hoping to see six months ago. We get our pep-talk and follow the Rabbi to the podium. The packed-house quiets to “Shabbat Shalom.”I was both so nervous for Sam and proud of him. “Please let him start out alright. Please let him remember the Hebrew words and their melody.” His small head peeks over the podium and adjusts the mic lower. He is doing it. He did the one-liner. The morning prayers pass by line-by-line with each response. He remembered them all with the correct chanting. I think his confidence is building. I think my confidence is building. Sam’s grandmother does a reading about how our child is not our masterpiece. But why does it seem like he is our masterpiece…he is performing masterfully. He doesn’t seem worried anymore. If it weren’t for the hard parts coming up, he might be enjoying this.We passed the Torah down three generations. The aunts and uncles watched Sam read from the Torah followed by the Tucker grandparents. Based on our rehearsals, there is something amazing about seeing that young hand move the Yod over the sacred parchment covered with hand-written Hebrew calligraphy. The same fingers that spend most of the day swiping and clicking now track over some of the oldest texts and language still around. The chanting is melodic, high-pitched, and quick due to the speedy small vocal cords of the singer. He glides through the four Aliyahs; the last being his own.As the Torah is dressed, the biggest hurdle lies ahead. That elusive Haftarah reading that was the bain of the last few weeks of study. It reads like a sailboat beating into the wind where each word is another wave to be breached. Sam heads up wind and tacks back and forth with full effort until he reaches his destination. The wind turns, and is now behind him for the after reading chant. The last word is followed with a sigh so deep, the back doors in the room blew open.If the haftarah was Sam’s vexation, the parent’s remarks were mine. The hanky was ready as I started the easy part. I tried to go slow, one sentence at a time. A pause here and there to catch myself. A little nose wipe and sniffle. Could they see how choked up I was? I was going to get through the words I wrote no matter what. I finished. They applauded…they didn’t know. Meg was perfectly poised as always.The adoration and praise wouldn’t stop. Sam had an audience and performed like a maestro. The typically quiet and stoic Matt cried words of wisdom that moved the crowd. The selfless mother Meg wove together the history of this mixed-religion but deeply faith-seeking families. Rejoice.The coats came off at the reception. Sam’s friends lifting lightweight Sam up like a hero. The Hora-circle was so big it snaked around the entire room. Sam was lifted in the chair.The joy and happiness radiated as people came out of their dwellings to gather in celebration of life.The circle continues.            Morning      Afternoon                              "

    "content": "With all the changes happening at Twitter in the last month, there has been much speculation of the future of this social media/news medium platform. The “what to do?” with Twitter is a question that has stood since its main debut in 2007 at the South by Southwest Festival. The thing that has sparked this latest debate is the $44 billon takeover of Twitter by a controversial technology billionaire who happens to be one of the world’s richest people.Why are people leaving?Full disclosure, I have been a longtime Twitter viewer, but not a poster. It took me a while to get into Twitter. The obsticle finding the right people or personalities to follow. Coming from Facebook, I was initially trying to find my friends and family to follow. Over time, I realized 1) that most of my friends and family were not on Twitter and 2) what they posted to Twitter was not that interesting and could be found on other social media. Next I started to follow famous people from TV or comedy. That helped, but it didn’t get me hooked. The trick was finding political, economic, or news wonks that posted multiple times a day on topics of interest. Combine that with some podcasters and some authors and scientists, I finally had a stream of intersting and relevant information that had me checking back in.Not everyone has this experience. If I tell my kids I am reading Twitter, they respond with “Who is salty on Twitter today?” Other people refer to Twitter as a flamming dumpster. Even well before the Elon Musk takeover, many people complained about the lack of moderation, trolling, bullying, and hate-speech. Those things are all true because Twitter is a fairly open sounding board and like-minded people will find each other creating an echo-chamber of close-minded trash (hence the dumpster fire). Twitter had problems moderating speech because unless you are threatening to harm someone or do something overtly illegal, there was very little recourse.So why are people leaving now? I think the main reason is because Elon Musk is reducing the very staff at Twitter who were trying to moderate and improve the platform. He is also bringing back suspended accounts as if they have served their punishment and should be given a second chance to behave according to the terms of service. The other reason which I like about humans is that people get wary when too much control is in the hands of too few people. Some people can’t stomach the idea of one person having the ability to change the rules or remove people from the platform. They are packing up their bags, saying it was fun while it lasted, but I am heading somewhere else. Where should I go?Enter MastodonI hear a lot of people saying that they are leaving Twitter and going to Mastodon. But what is Mastodon? Mastodon is a free and open-source software that people can run on a server to create their own social network. The free and open-source are key because on this platform, like bitcoin, no one really owns the platform. I could create a server and own that server. But my friend Marvin could also make a server. I could wall-off my server so that only the members of my server could talk to one another much like North Korea. Marvin could take the opposite route and let his server talk to all other servers that at least agree to basic content moderation. There could even pop up a pirate server that says we have no rules…post what you want and we will show what people post. As a user, I get to pick which type of server I want to join, and that server gets to pick what other servers it wants to federate with.In theory, this sounds awesome. In reality, it gets complicated and confusing. If I do want to pick up and leave the server I am a member of, I can’t just take my username and move all my posts to a new server. I will need to generate a username for that server and somehow let my followers know I moved.I decided to give Mastodon a try after hearing about it many times on the This Week in Google podcast for years. There is a TWIT (This Week in Tech) server that fans of This Week in Google can apply to become members. I applied, created a username and password, and a day later, I was in. And below is what it looks like.My Mastodon Home ScreenOne the left is a posting section where my @Tucker@twit.social handle is located and I can input text or links just like Twitter. The next column to the right is my Home feed that includes all the people I follow (which includes people in the same server as me or any other server that twit.social allows us to see based on the server owner’s rules). The middle column only shows posts from people in the local twit.social server. I don’t follow all of these people, so their posts do not show up in my Home feed. To the right of my Local Timeline is the Federated Timeline where I can see posts from any server that we federate with. And on the far right are tools to help get started.So far, it is much like Twitter. However, let’s look at an example when I tried to find and follow someone that I follow on Twitter. I typed in the search box on the upper left “Matthew Yglesias”. This person is a Washington DC journalist. In his Twitter profile, he states that he is a columnist for Bloomberg and he writes for the Slow Boring newletter. He post topics that I am either interested in, or like to see the comments since his has smart and witty followers. Mastodon gave me three different results with the same name. One of them has a blue check just like Twitter. So which one is him?Matthew Yglesias SearchJust like Twitter, you can put anything for the name of the account. Looking at the @handle, I find that each account is hosted on a different server. The first one is hosted at birdsitelive.janngobble.synology.me, says BOT next to his name, has 433 posts and only 1 follower. In the profile, it links back to his Twitter profile. The second one is hosted on birdsite.thorlaksson.com, says BOT next to his name, has 0 posts or followers, and links to his Twitter profile. The blue check version is hosted on twtr.plus, has a BOT next to his name, has 3 posts and no followers, and links to his Twitter profile and a twtr.plus page. So what the heck is going on?I followed the link to twtr.plus, and what I found is a service to make a person’s Mastodon home page similar to their Twitter feed. Imagine you could get everything you wanted on Mastodon, but there were a few people you follow that you know are not going to leave Twitter, and you want to see their posts. It looks as if this service is waiting for them to post to Twitter and then copy that post and send it to a Mastodon server to a particular follower.Twtr.plus About PageWhat I have learned from this is that not only is finding and verifying people more difficult with Mastodon, but there are active decoys out there thwaring my attempts to find people that I like to follow. Mastodon does have a way to verify accounts using the rel= “me” html linking to the owners website. I did this with my website such that Mastodon has verified that the person running @Tucker@twit.social is the same person running https://www.p5232.com since I was able to place code and links to each of those websites showing that I have control over them…not a BOT. When that link is verified, Mastodon puts a green check on the verified website. I am not sure how to add multiple websites to my Twitter profile so that account is not verifed. If someone knows how to do that, let me know.My Mastodon Profile PageIs Mastodon the New Twitter?In its current state Mastodon is not the new Twitter for the following reasons:  It is early and most of the people you want to follow are not there  There is a bit more tech involved in signing up and using the site so only the more tech-savvy people are making the switch  The big incumbents are going to continue to use Twitter (people with huge followers are not going to give that influence up)Instead of asking if Mastodon could be the new Twitter, I think the more important question is what could Mastodon be? Mastodon looks to be a place where tech enthusiasts can go to connect with like-minded people. For people who don’t like large companies controlling their home feed (Facebook) or companies shuttering unprofitable businesses (GooglePlus), this is an alternative culture or IndieWeb-like solution that puts the power back into the federated server operators. But like many niche technology websites, if there isn’t a ground-swell of users, the social network effects don’t allow it to persist.For now, I am still going to read Twitter and visit Mastodon."

    "content": "My wife has been taking collagen recently in the hopes that it would help suppliment or strengthen the collagen in her body tissues (she is well aware of the shoddy evidence on collagen but wanted to try it anyway). I didn’t think much of it, until I started reading a book called “Deep Nutrition” by Catherine Shanahan, M.D. This book was recommended on Twitter by a former vegan who said this book converted him back to meat. Since I am interested in the counter-arguements to my positions such as veganism, I gave the book a try. In the section about meat, the author talks about the importance of collagen in the diet and how patients with sore joints are cured when they get back to eating the collagen early humans ate.I was skeptical of this point. As with many key nutrients and proteins, our body has a way of recycling and generating these components. Look no further than cholesterol or vitamin D as examples of our bodies’ ability to create essential components. What happens during breast feeding or during early childhood development if the infants or children are not getting collagen? Well it turns out, collagen can be manufactured by the body using the amino acids proline, glycine, and hydroxyproline (Basics from the Cleveland Clinic ).I also learned that collagen is broken down in the stomach acid into its constitutive amino acids as they are then absorbed into the body. The supplement companies try to alter the collagen to make it bypass the stomach and get into the bloodstream. However, all of the research shows mixed results on collagen supplementation, and many of the studies are funded by companies that would benefit from such supplementation. It is interesting that the group of patients that benefitted the most from collagen supplementation were the ones with the worst joints. Is it possible that increased overall protein intake (by taking in collagen) helped those patients?From what I’ve read, I am not convinced anyone needs to ingest collagen. One must intake enough amino acids for proper protein synthesis. Whether that is from peas, soy, rice, or animal products, I don’t think it matters once it is denatured in the stomach acid.Below are links that I used for this shallow-wade into this topic. Let me know if you agree or disagree with my findings. References   Harvard School of Public Health Article  Beckman Laser Institue &amp; Mecial Clinic Article  Basics from the Cleveland Clinic"

    "content": "Leg warmers were a thing. Then they were not a thing. Then they were ostensibly extinct.I am neither a historian or fashionista; a detailed history and cultural relevance I leave to the reader.I am a middle-aged man who was told by those more competent long ago that it is not fashionable to wear calf-high (or knee-high God forbid) socks with my tennis shoes. Therefore, I threw away all my tube socks in the early 2000s like any competent male who has a fashion minded friend or partner or relative. It took a while, but my ankles finally acclimated to these super sleek ankle socks. Some people take things to the extreme with no-show socks; I am not that exotic.Everything was going fine until one combines winter, properly tailored pants, low-top shoes, and sitting or biking outside. If you don’t have any of those situations arrive in your daily life, stop reading now and go enjoy your warm weather, extra long pants, boots, or standing around.The problem only arose when I would sit in a chair on the porch trying to soak in the low-angle 12 o’clock sun on a crisp winter day. Just because it is 28 degrees F outside doesn’t mean we need to be stuck inside at all times. Put on a warm jacket, maybe a hat and some gloves, and bask in the sun while reading a good book. As I sat and read, I would notice everything remained warm except approximately 4 inches of my leg between my ankle and my calf. If only there was a way to keep that area warm without the “cancelled” tube socks. Partially Successful Ideas   Wear thick wooly long winter socks - causes sweaty feet when back inside (don’t get me started on wool on bare skin)  Wear thin thermal pants underneath jeans - great for super cold weather, get too hot when transitioning back inside  Cover the legs with a blanket - makes me feel like an old lady (no offense to old ladies…but I am not there yet)  Buy longer pants or tall boots - requires too drastic a change to my normal wardrobe  Buy boot gaiters - these look great for a hike in the snow, but overkill for sitting in solitudeEnter the Winner Leg Warmers in ActionAs you can see in the image above, the leg warmers are barely noticable under my jeans as they gently overlap my ANKLE SOCKS. Granted, the temperature outside was only about 50 degrees F and it wasn’t windy. The picture was more for demonstration purposes. Even so, my feet were not sweating, my ankles were warm, and I didn’t need to bring different pants or shoes to sit outside in the fall. Advantages of Leg Warmers   Only cover the areas that typically get cold outside when sitting  Easy to pack and don when required  Create an airtight seal to prevent wind flow up the leg  They show that you are a trend-setter that enjoys the outdoorsI personally bought my leg warmers on Amazon. I am putting the description below as the actual link could change in the future. Don’t let the “Women” in the description fool you…they fit both men and women. While on the subject, we don’t need to genderize simple clothing items such as leg warmers. As men, I think we need to stand in unity to bring back leg warmers for all gender identities.  Zando Women Fashion Leg Warmers Adult Junior 80s Ribbed Knitted Long Socks for Party Sports A Black One Size  V28 Women Juniors 80s Eighty’s Ribbed Leg Warmers for Party Sports (Black)I give the items 4 stars out of 5. They are a bit baggier than I would have expected. They don’t slip off my feet, however, they don’t stay tight against my leg as I lower my jeans over them. The result is a bunched up mess of ribbed acrylic stuck between the top of my shoe and inside the bottom of my jeans. This plug that is formed is not physically satisfying, but the lack of cold air up the leg is satisfying. I would like them a little tighter against my legs using a soft cotton to prevent the feeling of dropping. However, they are extremely effective. These can be my “starter” leg warmers. It is best not to invest too much time (such as a full blog post) and money in a new idea. Test the water with &lt;$10 acrylic loose leg warmers before diving into high-end handmade leg warmers made from Merino wool.Comfortable temperature ankle Matt signing off."

    "content": "I recently went for a jog and listened to  Peter Attia, M.D. interview Erin Michols, M.D. on the topic of cardiovascular disease in women. Though the podcast was mostly about women’s health and the nuances of the various lipids, hormones, and other chemicals during different stages of their lives, there was an off-the-cuff statement by Peter that makes me ponder.He stated that given the 5 pillars through which we can impact a person’s health - nutrition, exercise, sleep, emotional/mental health, and pharmacotherapy, he believes…  “The lowest impact in my view on cardiovascular disease is through nutrition.” At first, I want to argue this point. We are typically taught that diet alone can change our body, our mind, and can reverse diseases like diabetes. But that all may be true to a certain extent while not affecting our risk for cardiovascular disease.For example, when I got my latest bloodwork while being a strict vegan for over two years, my LDL-C was calculated at 90 mg/dL. In prior years, it has ranged from 81 to 95 mg/dL. Assuming LDL-C is the closest measure we have on these old bloodwork records, it doesn’t seem like cutting out all meat and dairy had much of an effect. Dr. Erin Michols also stated that she has vegan patients that do everything right and still have high cholesterol which frustrates them. She acknowledges that a poor diet would make their numbers even higher and believes the diet may influence about 20% of the LDL while genetics and the liver make up the other 80%.This anecdotal information is ancillary to my main thought experiment. Accepting Peter’s premise, what would we change in our lives or society to reduce the incidence of Arteriosclerotic Heart Disease (ASHD)? Dr. Michols was co-author on an American Heart Association statement that suggest the many methods to affect ASHD both positively and negatively.Psychological factors that influence cardiovascular health. Image credit: Circulation 2021Another thing Peter mentioned is that atherosclerosis is caused by the duration and level of apoB (which includes LDL) in the blood vessels over time and over a certain pressure. It is like adding up the area under a curve. The longer the apoB is high, the longer the pressure is elevated, the more time you have on this planet, then the higher the buildup of calcium and risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.My take away is to put more emphasis on the other factors. I am putting my bet on exercise, sleep, and stress reduction. Exercise is away to reduce stress, increase blood flow, and increase metabolic activity. Getting good quality sleep gives the body time to repair and rejuvenate. Finally, finding ways to purposefully reduce stress can go a long way (easier said than done as we meet up with family and fall back into hold habit snow track grooves). I look forward to learning more in the future if nutrition is the smallest of the 5 pillars for affecting cardiovascular disease. Let me know which pillar you think you can change for positive heart health benefits."
