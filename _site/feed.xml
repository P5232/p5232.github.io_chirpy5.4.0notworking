      Riding the wave of positive family religious experiences of late (see Sam’s Bar Mitzvah), we decided to venture back to Church after about an 8-year respite. Spoiler alert, it was actually a nice and welcoming experience. To find out more, read on; otherwise, you got the main point.

It has been a tradition in my wife’s family to attend Christmas Eve services followed by dinner and some present...

      You see it coming 18,000 miles away. Not to worry.

Twelve-year birthday; pick a Saturday. Text and Email family. Excitement brewing.

Nine months away. The study with the Rabbi begins. Start slow. Summarize the Torah portion. Tallit blessing is a one-liner. The morning prayers accumulate week-by-week.

Six months away and save-the-dates are delivered throughout the country. Reasons to talk to ...

      With all the changes happening at Twitter in the last month, there has been much speculation of the future of this social media/news medium platform. The “what to do?” with Twitter is a question that has stood since its main debut in 2007 at the South by Southwest Festival. The thing that has sparked this latest debate is the $44 billon takeover of Twitter by a controversial technology billiona...

      My wife has been taking collagen recently in the hopes that it would help suppliment or strengthen the collagen in her body tissues (she is well aware of the shoddy evidence on collagen but wanted to try it anyway). I didn’t think much of it, until I started reading a book called “Deep Nutrition” by Catherine Shanahan, M.D. This book was recommended on Twitter by a former vegan who said this bo...

I am neither a historian or fashionista; a detailed history and cultural relevance I leave to the reader.

I am a middle-aged man who was told by those more competent long ago that it is not fashionable to wear calf-high (or knee-high God forbid) socks with my tennis shoes. Therefore, I threw away all my t...
